In the first step, the user is able to request and get an access token by providing Clientid, ClientSecret. Then, the user has to fill the details of the experiment (ExperimenterId, ExperimentId, ApplicationId). In the last step (i.e. step 3), the user can post a new asset to the specific experiment by pressing the “Post Random Asset” button.
