# Experimenter Portal

The Experimenter Portal provides a common interface for the experimenters to carry out experiment management and to start the interaction of your experiment with different services (e.g. annotations, authorization, etc.). An experiment can be seen as a entity that allows you to interact with the Organicity facility. Besides, within an experiment you can defined a number of applications, also entities, so that when you create assets you have to indicate which application of which experiment has created it. It is worth highlighting that an Organicity application refers just to the entity (an identifier), that will be afterwards used in *real* applications (such as smartphone applications) to enable the interaction with Organicity,

In the following the features of the Experimenter Portal are desbried in a comprehensive way.

First you need to log into the the portal (http://experimenters.organicity.eu/). In case you do not manage to perform the login, contact the facility managers through [helpdesk@organicity.eu](mailto:helpdesk@organicity.eu) to obtain proper credentials.

When you enter the portal for the same time, you will find an empty table and a button to create a new experiment. Besides, from the header you may navigate to different services and tools of Organicity; we do not detail each service and tool here, go [Home](/index) for more information.

All you need to do to start the experimentation is clicking **NEW EXPERIMENT** button. Through the portal you will find some rounded blue icons that will provide you information at each step.


## Create and edit experiments

As can be seen in the figure below, an experiment can be created by just defining:
* Name: Name of the experiment to be shows afterwards
* Description: meaningful and catchy description of the experiment. This description will be used if you decide to invite people to participate in your experiment
* Assets privacy: choose whether or not you want your asstes to be public or private. Note that by doing them private only your experiment will be able to access their data.

Besides, if it is necessary you may also define the experiment area, by clinking **EXPERIMENT AREA**. The area is made of regions, that in turn is defined as a polygon with a name, as depicted belor. You can define as many regions you want for your experiment.

Once you are done, click **FINISH** to complete the experiment creation.

## Experiment Credentials

When an experiment is created a new *client* is created for that experiment. You may use that client to implement authorization in the applications within the experiment, see [How To Authenticate An User](/HowToAuthenticateAnUser).

From that client you can define and edit *redirect_uris* as you need.

## Create and edit applications

As mentioned before, to create assets the experiment does not suffice, but you need to do it through applications within the experiment. To create an applciation just go to the **Applications** section of you experiment **NEW APPLICATION**. As you can see below, you have to provide minimal information to create it.
