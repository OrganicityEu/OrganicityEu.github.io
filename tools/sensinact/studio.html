<h2>Studio</h2>

<p>SensiNact Studio allows an easy interaction with the OrganiCity  devices and the creation of applications. The Studio is based on the Eclipse platform [Eclipse] and built as a rich client platform application. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is developed using the views mechanism from Eclipse. Thus, it propose s views for browsing devices, locating devices on a map and interacting with them, i.e., getting value from sensors or performing actions on actuators. The Studio is also targeted to ease the creation of IoT application following the Event-Condition-Action (ECA) pattern [Den89].</p>

<p>The GUI includes different views: navigator, deployment, properties views, as well as a Domain Specific Language (DSL) editor.</p>


<h3>Browsing devices</h3>

<p>Before users can use the studio for managing devices and applications, they need to connect a SensiNact gateway (see paragraph 4.3). This action is performed by clicking on the plus sign icon on the device navigator. Then, gateway information have to be provided.</p>

<p>Once the information have been provided and the dialog validated, the Gateway is added to the Navigator View. To display and browse the available devices imported by this gateway, connecting to it is needed. This action is performed using the connect button.</p>

<p>The device Navigator View is then populated, and pin points are displayed on the map. By clicking on attributes names, it is possible to get the current value for the considered attribute. It is also possible to see attributes values on the map, clicking on the pin points.</p>
