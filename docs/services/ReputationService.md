An important job of the Urban Data Observatory Services is helping users navigate the many assets available from the OrganiCity platform. The Assets Reputation Service is responsible for calculating the reputation of the various assets available on the OrganiCity platform. Reputation (what is generally said or believed about an assetâ€™s reliability) captures a combined measure of reliability inferred from feedback by a community of end-users. In a stricter and personalized way, reputation can be conceived as trust, by modeling the degree the trust an end-user assigns to each specific assets they used. In our case, we focus on the generic notion of reputation that is public and combined and not on the personal and subjective one. By modelling reputation of assets, OrganiCity enables users and asset/service providers to differentiate among the assets based on how well these assets behaved in the history. This facilitates end-users and decision makers to distinguish good assets from bad ones based on user's feedbacks.
